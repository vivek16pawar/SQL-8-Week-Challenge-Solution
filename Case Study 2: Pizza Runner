***SECTION 2: PIZZA METRICS***


1.How many pizzas were ordered?
SELECT COUNT(pizza_id) AS total_pizza_orders
FROM customer_orders;


2.How many unique customer orders were made?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS unique_customer_order
FROM customer_orders;

3.How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
SELECT runner_id,COUNT(*) AS no_of_successful_orders_delivered
FROM runner_orders
WHERE distance <> 'null'
GROUP BY runner_id;

4.How many of each type of pizza was delivered?
SELECT pizza_name,COUNT(*) no_of_pizza_dilevered
FROM customer_orders
JOIN runner_orders
USING(order_id)
JOIN pizza_names
ON customer_orders.pizza_id = pizza_names.pizza_id
WHERE distance <> 'null'
GROUP BY pizza_name;


5.How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer
SELECT customer_id,
SUM(CASE WHEN pizza_name = 'Vegetarian' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS veg_orders,
SUM(CASE WHEN pizza_name = 'Meatlovers' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS meat_orders
FROM customer_orders
JOIN pizza_names
USING(pizza_id)
GROUP BY customer_id;

6.What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?
SELECT max_pizza_count FROM(SELECT order_id,COUNT(pizza_id) AS max_pizza_count
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY max_pizza_count DESC
LIMIT 1) AS pizza_counts;

9.What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?
SELECT EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) AS hours,COUNT(pizza_id) AS volume_of_pizza
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time)
ORDER BY hours;

10.What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?
SELECT DAYNAME(order_time) AS day_of_week,COUNT(pizza_id) AS volume_of_pizza
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY DAYNAME(order_time)
ORDER BY day_of_week;


***SECTION 3: RUNNER AND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE***

1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01) 
SELECT week(registration_date) AS weeks,COUNT(*) AS total_signups
FROM runners
GROUP BY week(registration_date);


2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
WITH CTE AS(SELECT *, TIMEDIFF(pickup_time,order_time) AS time_difference
FROM customer_orders1
JOIN runner_orders1
USING(order_id)
WHERE distance IS NOT NULL)
SELECT runner_id,AVG(minute(time_difference)) AS avg_time
FROM CTE
GROUP BY runner_id;


3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
WITH CTE AS(SELECT COUNT(pizza_id) AS no_of_pizzas,timediff(pickup_time,order_time) AS duration
FROM customer_orders1
JOIN runner_orders1
USING(order_id)
WHERE distance IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY order_id)
SELECT no_of_pizzas,ROUND(AVG(minute(duration)),2) AS time_taken
FROM CTE
GROUP BY no_of_pizzas;

4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
SELECT customer_id,ROUND(AVG(distance),2) AS avg_distance_travelled
FROM customer_orders1
JOIN runner_orders1
USING(order_id)
WHERE distance IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY customer_id;

5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
WITH CTE AS (SELECT *,LEFT(duration,2) AS mod_duration 
FROM customer_orders1
JOIN runner_orders1
USING(order_id)
WHERE distance IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT MAX(mod_duration) - MIN(mod_duration) AS delivery_time_difference
FROM CTE;


6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
SELECT runner_id,distance,order_id,ROUND(AVG(distance/(LEFT(duration,2)/60)),2) AS avg_speed
FROM customer_orders1
JOIN runner_orders1
USING(order_id)
WHERE distance IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY runner_id,order_id
ORDER BY runner_id;

7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?
SELECT runner_id,SUM(CASE WHEN distance <> 'null' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS successful_delivery,COUNT(order_id) AS total_delivery
,ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN distance <> 'null' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100/COUNT(order_id),2) AS successful_delivery_perc
FROM runner_orders1
GROUP BY runner_id;
